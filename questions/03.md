# Fundamentals: Conditionals

What will this code output to the terminal?

```rb
name = "Steven"
puts "Hi, #{name}" if name == "Steven"
```

## Correct

```rb
"Hi, Steven"
```

> Right! We're using `if` as a statement modifier, and since `name == "Steven"`
> is true, the output will be the name's value interpolated into the string.

## Incorrect

```rb
"Hi, #{name}"
```

> We're using `if` as a statement modifier, and since `name == "Steven"` is
> true, the output will be the name's value interpolated into the string. You
> won't see the `#{}` in the terminal â€” you'll see the string `"Steven"`
> instead.

## Incorrect

Nothing

> We're using `if` as a statement modifier, and since `name == "Steven"` is
