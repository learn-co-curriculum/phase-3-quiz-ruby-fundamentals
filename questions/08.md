# Fundamentals: Operators

Which of the following methods would correctly return `true` when given the
letter `"o"` as an argument?

## Correct

```rb
def vowels_with_if_single_line(letter)
  true if letter == "a" || letter == "e" || letter == "i" || letter == "o" || letter == "u"
end
```

> Right! We can use the `||` (OR) operator to check if the letter matches any vowel.

## Incorrect

```rb
def vowels_with_if_single_line(letter)
  true if letter == "a" && letter == "e" && letter == "i" && letter == "o" && letter == "u"
end
```

> The `&&` (AND) operator won't work here, since it only returns true of both
> sides of the operator are truthy, and a letter can't be `a` AND `e` AND `i`
> AND `o` AND `u` simultaneously.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
