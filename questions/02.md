# Fundamentals: Conditionals

The method `vowels_with_case` takes in a letter as an argument and uses a `case`
statement to determine if that letter is a vowel:

```rb
def vowels_with_case(letter)
  case letter
  ___________ "a"
    true
  ___________ "e"
    true
  ___________ "i"
    true
  ___________ "o"
    true
  ___________ "u"
    true
  else
    false
  end
end
```

Which keyword correctly replaces the blanks in the code above?

## Incorrect

```rb
if
```

> `if` statements are an alternative to `case` statements, but those two
> keywords aren't used together.

## Incorrect

```rb
then
```

> Not quite. `then` is used with `case` statements, but it comes _after_ the
> condition to help write more concise code:
>
> ```rb
> case letter
>   when "a" then true
>   when "e" then true
>   when "i" then true
>   when "o" then true
>   when "u" then true
>   else false
> end
> ```

## Correct

```rb
when
```

> Correct! `when` works with case to allow multiple branching conditions against
> the same value.

## Incorrect

```rb
while
```

> `while` is used for looping, not branching conditions.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
