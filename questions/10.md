# Fundamentals: Operators

We have a method `returning_false` that uses both comparison and boolean
operators:

```rb
def returning_false
  7 > 4 && 100 < ?
end
```

What value(s) for `?` will make `returning_false` return `false`? Select all
that apply.

## Correct

100

> Right! For the `&&` operator to return false, both sides of the operator must
> be false.

## Incorrect

101

> For the `&&` operator to return false, both sides of the operator must
> be false. `100 < 101` evaluates to `true`, so this would return `true`.

## Incorrect

102

> For the `&&` operator to return false, both sides of the operator must
> be false. `100 < 102` evaluates to `true`, so this would return `true`.

## Incorrect

103

> For the `&&` operator to return false, both sides of the operator must
> be false. `100 < 103` evaluates to `true`, so this would return `true`.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
