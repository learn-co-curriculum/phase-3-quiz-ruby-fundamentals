# Fundamentals: Looping

Here is a repeated list of `puts` statements.

```rb
puts "hi"
puts "hi"
puts "hi"
puts "hi"
puts "hi"
```

How would you repeat this with a `while` loop 100 times?

## Correct

```rb
counter = 0

while counter < 100 do
  puts "hi"
  counter += 1
end
```

> Right! Since we start the counter at 0 and keep it running as long as the
> counter is less than 100, this will loop 100 times (starting from 0 and
> continuing until the counter is 99).

## Incorrect

```rb
counter = 1

while counter < 100 do
  puts "hi"
  counter += 1
end
```

> Close, but not quite. Since the counter starts at one and the while loop only
> runs while the counter is **less than** 100, this will only run our loop 99
> times.

## Incorrect

```rb
while true do
  puts "hi"
end
```

> Be careful with this one â€” since the condition will always be `true` and
> there's no `break` from the loop, this will run in an infinite loop!

## Incorrect

I don't know.
