# Fundamentals: Conditionals

Let's refactor this code using a ternary operator:

```rb
if condition_a
  something
else
  something_else
end
```

Which of the following is correct?

## Correct

```rb
condition_a ? something : something_else
```

> Right! With the ternary operator, the first part is the condition, the second
> part is what will be returned if the condition is true, and the last part is
> what will be returned if the condition is false. We want to return `something`
> when `condition_a` is true, and `something_else` when `condition_a` is false.

## Incorrect

```rb
condition_a ? something_else : something
```

> With the ternary operator, the first part is the condition, the second part is
> what will be returned if the condition is true, and the last part is what will
> be returned if the condition is false. We want to return `something` when
> `condition_a` is true, and `something_else` when `condition_a` is false.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
