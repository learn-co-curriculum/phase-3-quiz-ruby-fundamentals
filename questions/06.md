# Fundamentals: Looping

What will this loop do?

```rb
x = 0
while x < 10 do
  puts "so many loops"
end
```

## Correct

Output `"so many loops"` infinitely

> Right! Since we never change the value of `x`, `x` will always be less than
> 10, so the condition for the `while` loop is always true.

## Incorrect

Output `"so many loops"` one time

> Since we never change the value of `x`, `x` will always be less than 10, so
> the condition for the `while` loop is always true.

## Incorrect

Output `"so many loops"` 10 times

> Since we never change the value of `x`, `x` will always be less than 10, so
> the condition for the `while` loop is always true.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
