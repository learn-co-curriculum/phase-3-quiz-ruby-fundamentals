# Fundamentals: Conditionals

What will this code print out:

```rb
name = "Steven"
puts "Hi, #{name}" unless name == "Steven"
```

## Correct

Nothing

> Right! We're using `unless` as a statement modifier, and since `name == "Steven"`
> is not false, nothing will be output.

## Incorrect

```rb
"Hi, #{name}"
```

> We're using `unless` as a statement modifier, and since `name == "Steven"` is
> not false, nothing will be output. Even if it was false, you wouldn't see the
> `#{}` in the terminal â€” you'd see the string `"Steven"` instead.

## Incorrect

```rb
"Hi, Steven"
```

> We're using `unless` as a statement modifier, and since `name == "Steven"`
> is not false, nothing will be output.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
