# Fundamentals: Operators

We have a method `using_truthiness` that should return true:

```rb
def using_truthiness
  7 > 8 || ?
end
```

What value(s) for `?` will make this method return `true`? Select all that
apply.

## Correct

```rb
true
```

> Right! With the `||` (OR) operator, either the left side or the right side
> must be truthy in order for the operator to return true.

## Incorrect

```rb
false
```

> With the `||` (OR) operator, either the left side or the right side must be
> truthy in order for the operator to return true. In this case, neither `7 > 8`
> or `false` are truthy.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
